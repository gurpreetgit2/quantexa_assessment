  * Part of the Quantexa solution is to flag high risk countries as a link to these countries may be an indication of

  * For this question you are required to populate the flag in the ScoringModel case class where the customer has an
  * address in the British Virgin Islands.
  *
  * This flag must be then used to return the number of customers in the dataset that have a link to a British Virgin
  * Islands address.
